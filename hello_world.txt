My name is Mwansa Chilekwa and I am learning software development.
I am so passionate about coding and the aspects of problem solving
skills that are acquired through the process.
Being a software developer helps the developer to analyze societal 
problems as opportunities. Thus, they can use the said skills to
solve societal problems technically through technology.
